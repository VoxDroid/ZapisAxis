## Introduction

ZapisAxis is a comprehensive Financial Management System (FMS) developed as a college project for the **ITEC 204** course at **Laguna State Polytechnic University - San Pablo City Campus (LSPU-SCC)**. Designed specifically for the **Student Organization of the College of Computer Studies (SOCCS)**, ZapisAxis provides an intuitive and robust platform to manage financial operations, including budgeting, expense tracking, student payment records, and transaction logging. Built using **C#** with a **MySQL** backend, this application serves as both a practical learning tool for students and a functional solution for SOCCS's financial management needs.

The system aims to streamline financial processes, enhance transparency, and ensure accountability while offering a user-friendly interface tailored to the needs of a student organization. ZapisAxis is open-source, allowing for further development and customization by the community.

## Features

ZapisAxis offers a wide range of features to support efficient financial management:

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean, intuitive design built with **Bunifu UI** and **Guna UI** frameworks, ensuring ease of navigation for users with varying technical expertise.
- **Budget Tracking**: Manage budgets for events, projects, and activities with real-time tracking of allocations and remaining funds (`SubBudMan.cs`, `ModBudMan.cs`).
- **Expense Management**: Record, categorize, and analyze expenses to monitor spending patterns and make informed financial decisions (`SubTranLo.cs`, `ModTranLo.cs`).
- **Student Payment Management**: Track student charges, payments, and debts, with automated status updates (e.g., Paid, Partial) (`StudentFile.cs`, `ModStudFil.cs`).
- **Transaction Logs**: Maintain a detailed history of financial transactions for auditing and reference purposes (`SubTranLo.cs`, `ModTranLo.cs`).
- **Dashboard**: Provides a quick overview of key financial metrics, including total funds, uncollected dues, and charged amounts.
- **Export Options**: Export financial data in multiple formats (CSV, Excel, PDF, JSON, XML, SQLite, TXT) for reporting and external analysis (`Export.cs`).
- **Backup and Recovery**: Safeguard data with backup generation and database restoration capabilities (`Settings.cs`).
- **Data Migrations**: Seamlessly migrate data between environments to support scalability and testing.
- **Security Features**: Implement user authentication, role-based access, security questions for account recovery, and animated login transitions (`Login.cs`, `SetupSQ.cs`, `Recovery.cs`).
- **Database Management**: Reset or delete specific data categories (e.g., budget management, transaction logs, student files) with reset key authentication (`Settings.cs`).
- **Admin Controls**: Manage user accounts, set reset keys, and configure security settings (exclusive to admin users) (`AdminPage.cs`).

## System Architecture

ZapisAxis is built using a client-server architecture with the following components:

- **Frontend**: A Windows Forms application developed in **C#**, utilizing **Bunifu UI** and **Guna UI** for a modern, responsive interface.
- **Backend**: A **MySQL** database (`zapisaxisfms`) hosted locally via **XAMPP**, storing financial and user data.
- **Data Access**: The application interacts with the MySQL database using the **MySql.Data.MySqlClient** library for secure and efficient data operations.
- **External Libraries**:
  - **ClosedXML**: For exporting data to Excel.
  - **PdfSharp**: For generating PDF reports.
  - **Newtonsoft.Json**: For JSON serialization.
  - **System.Data.SQLite**: For exporting data to SQLite databases.

The system follows a modular design, with separate classes for managing different functionalities (e.g., `Dashboard.cs`, `StudentFile.cs`, `ModStudFil.cs`, `SubBudMan.cs`, `ModBudMan.cs`, `SubTranLo.cs`, `ModTranLo.cs`, `Export.cs`, `AdminPage.cs`, `Login.cs`), ensuring maintainability and scalability.

## Database Structure

The `zapisaxisfms` database consists of the following key tables:

- **budman** (Budget Management):
  - `bm_id` (Primary Key): Unique budget ID.
  - `name`: Budget name.
  - `category`: Budget category (e.g., Event, Project).
  - `allocation`: Allocated amount.
  - `remaining`: Remaining budget.

- **tranlo** (Transaction Logs):
  - `tl_id` (Primary Key): Unique transaction ID.
  - `date`: Transaction date.
  - `name`: Transaction name.
  - `description`: Transaction details.
  - `category`: Transaction category.
  - `amount`: Transaction amount.

- **studfil** (Student File):
  - `pm_id` (Primary Key): Payment ID.
  - `sn_id`: Student ID (links to `studname`).
  - `name`: Student name.
  - `charge`: Charged amount.
  - `amountpaid`: Paid amount.
  - `paymentdate`: Payment date.
  - `paymentstatus`: Payment status (e.g., Paid, Partial).

- **studdeb** (Student Debts):
  - `sn_id` (Primary Key): Student ID.
  - `debtamount`: Total unpaid dues.
  - `hasdebt`: Boolean indicating debt status.

- **studname** (Student Names):
  - `sn_id` (Primary Key): Unique student ID.
  - `name`: Student full name.

- **users**:
  - `user_id` (Primary Key): Unique user ID.
  - `username`: User login name.
  - `password`: User password (stored in plain text; consider encryption in future versions).

- **su** (Super Users):
  - `user_id`: Links to `users` table to identify admin accounts.

- **securityquestions**:
  - `sqs_id` (Primary Key): Unique ID (set to 1).
  - `sq1`, `sq2`, `sq3`: Security questions.
  - `sq1a`, `sq2a`, `sq3a`: Corresponding answers.

- **resetkeys**:
  - `id` (Primary Key): Unique ID (set to 1).
  - `reset_key`: Key for authorizing database resets.

The database is initialized automatically upon first run (`DatabaseInitializer.cs`), creating all necessary tables and setting default values (e.g., admin user).

## Security Features

ZapisAxis incorporates several security mechanisms to protect data and access:

- **User Authentication**:
  - Users log in with a username and password stored in the `users` table (`Login.cs`).
  - Admin accounts (marked in the `su` table) have elevated privileges.

- **Role-Based Access**:
  - Only admin users can access the **Admin Page** and perform actions like user management or reset key configuration (`AdminPage.cs`).

- **Security Questions**:
  - Users can set three security questions for account recovery (`SetupSQ.cs`).
  - Answers are stored in the `securityquestions` table and validated case-insensitively.

- **Reset Key**:
  - A unique reset key (stored in `resetkeys`) is required for sensitive operations like data deletion or database resets.
  - Admins can generate or update the reset key via the **Admin Page** (`AdminPage.cs`).

- **Recovery File**:
  - User account details are exported to a `za_recoveraccounts_YYYYMMDD.txt` file when creating, updating, or deleting users, ensuring a backup for recovery.

- **Animated Login**:
  - The login interface features smooth animations for loading, control toggles, and transitions, enhancing user experience (`Login.cs`).

**Note**: Passwords are currently stored in plain text. For production use, consider implementing password hashing (e.g., using BCrypt or SHA-256) to enhance security.

## Export Options

ZapisAxis supports exporting data in the following formats:

- **CSV**: Comma-separated values for easy import into spreadsheets.
- **Excel (XLSX)**: Formatted spreadsheets using ClosedXML.
- **PDF**: Printable reports generated with PdfSharp.
- **JSON**: Structured data for interoperability, using Newtonsoft.Json.
- **XML**: Hierarchical data format for compatibility with other systems.
- **SQLite**: Portable database file for offline use.
- **TXT**: Plain text with tab-separated values.

To export data:
1. Navigate to the **Export** page (`Export.cs`).
2. Select the table (Budget Management, Transaction Logs, or Student File).
3. Choose the desired format and save location.
4. The system validates data availability before exporting.

## Backup and Recovery

ZapisAxis provides robust backup and recovery options to ensure data safety:

- **Backup Database**:
  - Generates a `.sql` file (e.g., `zapisaxisfms_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql`) containing the entire database.
  - Requires reset key authentication.
  - Accessible via the **Settings** page (`Settings.cs`).

- **Import Database**:
  - Overwrites the existing database with data from a selected `.sql` file.
  - Requires reset key and confirmation text (`IMPORT`).
  - Restarts the application upon successful import.

- **Reset Database**:
  - Drops and recreates the `zapisaxisfms` database, initializing it with default schema and data.
  - Requires reset key and confirmation text (`RESET`).
  - Restarts the application after completion.

- **Account Recovery**:
  - Admins can recover credentials by answering security questions via the **Recovery** form (`Recovery.cs`).
  - The system retrieves the admin username and password from the `users` table if answers match.
